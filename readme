npm init 
- npm init creates a package.json file which helps you manage dependencies (which we will install as we go through the tutorial).

npm install express --save
- The --save flag saves express as a dependency in package.json. It’s important to know these dependencies because npm can retrieve dependencies with another npm install command when you need it later.

npm install nodemon --save-dev
- Nodemon restarts the server automatically when you save a file that’s used by the server.js. We can install Nodemon with the following command

npm install body-parser --save
- Body-parser is a middleware. They help to tidy up the request object before we use them. Express lets us use middleware with the use method

npm install mongodb --save
-once installed, we can connect to MongoDB through the MongoClient’s connect method

npm install ejs --save
